/// <reference types="Cypress" /> allows us to leverage VS Code Intellisense for the autocompletion

Cypress is asynchronous in nature and there is no gaurantee in sequence of execution, but the cypress
takes care of it. It uses then() for handling asynchronous behaiour internally.

Alias (as) use to optimize the code by resuing the locators

Cypress auto accepts alerts and pop up
Cypress has capability of browser events window:alert which get fired on alert open
Cypress has capability to manipulate DOM 

next() is used to move from one sibling to its next sibling

There is no built in support in cypress to hover on an element, JQuery's method as 
show() is used to hover.
If the one does not want to use show method, then one must use click({force:true}) to disable
error checking

invoke() is used to define JQuery methods

each($el,index,$list) - Is use for iteration purpose

Cypress does not support cross domain functionality, it means two different Urls
cannot be opened on one common window/tab but it can be achieved by extracting 
the href property value using prop() of JQuery.
The prop() method sets or returns properties and values of the selected elements.
But we cannot call Prop() directly, we need to resolve promises using then() and after that we need
to use origin() which will help to click on the elemnt of different domain.

origin() - Enables running Cypress commands in a secondary origin.

npm install -D cypress-iframe is to install iframe in cypress to handle iframe functionality
and need to import "cypress-iframe"
frameLoaded() is to tell the cypress which iframe to load for performing actions
iframe() is to tell cypress that we need to perform an action within iframe and not on regular DOM.

hooks in cypress is useful to set conditions before/before each set of test/tests and
also useful to clean up conditions after a set of tests or after each test

cy.pause() - For debugging
pause() will stop test execution to inspect the web application, the DOM, the network.
debug() will stop only when the developer tools are open.

defaultCommandTimeout variable set in config file behaves like implicit waits in selenium.
Cypress.Config('defaultCommandTimeout',5000) - behaves like explicit waits in selenium. It is
respecive to spec level.

Number() is used to convert string into int.

runMode in config file allows us to run the failed TC again and again depends on the number provided.
and it will work only when we run the cypress through terminal in headed mode.
To capture video, Screenshots and html report: npx cypress run --spec cypress\e2e\Introduction.js --headed --browser chrome
OR npx cypress run -b chrome OR
./node_modules/.bin/cypress run -e TAGS='@RunMe' --headless --browser chrome

Install cucumber
npm install @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor

shadow() is used to find invisible elements
cy.get().shadow().find().click()

cy.title() - to fetch the title

The difference between == and === is that: 
== converts the variable values to the same type before performing comparison. This is called type coercion. 
=== does not do any type conversion (coercion) and returns true only if both values and types are identical for the two variables being compared.
