//String is an object that represents sequence of char values. An array of characters works same as Java string.
		
//Why String objects are immutable in Java? - As Java uses the concept of String literal. Suppose there are 5 reference variables, all refer to one object "Sachin". If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected by all the reference variables.
		
//We can compare String in Java on the basis of content and reference.

//It is used in authentication (by equals() method), sorting (by compareTo() method), reference matching (by == operator) etc.

//In Java, String concatenation forms a new String that is the combination of multiple strings.
//By + (String concatenation) operator
//By concat() method
//By format() method
//By join() method
		
//StringBuilder is fastest way to concatenate strings in Java. 
//It is mutable class which means values stored in StringBuilder objects can be updated or changed.

//String.format() method allows to concatenate multiple strings using format specifier like %s followed by the string values or objects.
