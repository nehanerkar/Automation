	 * The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and
	 * manipulating a group of objects. It has: Interfaces and its implementations,
	 * i.e., classes Algorithm

	//Iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in a forward direction only.

	//Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.

	/*
	 * Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements. 
	 * Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order. 
	 * Java ArrayList class is non synchronized. 
	 * Java ArrayList allows random access because the array works on an index basis. 
	 * In ArrayList, manipulation is a little bit slower than the LinkedList in Java
	 * because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the
	 * array list. 
	 * We can not create an array list of the primitive types, such as
	 * int, float, char, etc. It is required to use the required wrapper class in
	 * such cases.
	 * Java ArrayList gets initialized by the size. The size is dynamic in the array list, which varies according to the elements getting added or removed from the list.
